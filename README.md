## About the Project

For this homework assignment I was given a html, css and JavaScript document. My goal was to write some JavaScript code that would prompt the user to
select some criteria for a randomly generated password. The password would then be displayed to the user in the "Generate Password" box. When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button they are prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Then a series of confirms ask the user if they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. The password is then randomly generated to fit the criteria that has been selected.
